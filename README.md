CS70 Homework LaTeX Template
=====

#####This template can save you time from customizing packages and enumerating lists

How To Use
-----

1. Enter HW number, your name, account, and date in the field which said
```
\title{}
\author{}
\date{}
```
2. Then each section beginning with
```
\paragraph{}
```
is the place for each problem (usually 8 in total for one homework, if more just copy and paste the template)

3. Inside each ``\paragraph`` is the field which contains
```
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\item
\end{enumerate}
```
This field is where you put your answer into each sub-question. (each item corresponds to each sub-question)

4. You are done!
